## What Are Hotkeys?

Hotkeys are pre-configured item buttons that appear on the right side of the Sale screen (when no line is selected). They let staff add frequently sold items with a single tap instead of scanning.

---

## Accessing

From the Home screen, tap **Hotkey Manager**. Requires the **hotkey** permission.

---

## Structure

Hotkeys are organised in **groups** (tabs). Each group contains a **6×6 grid** of item buttons.

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Group** | A named tab (e.g. "Drinks", "Snacks") with a colour |
| **Cell** | One position in the 6×6 grid |
| **Key** | An item assigned to a cell — shows the item name and group colour |

## On the Sale Screen

When no line is selected in the cart, the hotkey grid appears on the right side. Tapping a hotkey button is equivalent to scanning that item's barcode — it adds the item to the cart using the same pricing and merge logic.

Groups appear as tabs — tap a tab to switch between hotkey pages.
