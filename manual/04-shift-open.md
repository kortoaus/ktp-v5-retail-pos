## What Is a Shift?

A shift represents a working period on a single terminal. All sales, refunds, and cash movements during the shift are linked to it. When the shift is closed, everything is summarised in a settlement report.

**Only one shift can be open per terminal at a time.**

## Who Can Open a Shift

Only users with the **shift** permission can open or close shifts. You will be prompted to log in if not already authenticated.

## Steps

1. From the Home screen, tap **Open Shift** (only visible when no shift is open).
2. **Count the cash in the drawer** using the denomination grid.
3. Optionally add a **note** (e.g. "Float from yesterday", "Morning shift").
4. Tap **Open Shift** to confirm.

## Cash Counter

The denomination grid lets you count cash by tapping each bill/coin type and entering the quantity:

| Denomination | Values |
|-------------|--------|
| Notes | $100, $50, $20, $10, $5 |
| Coins | $2, $1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c |

For each denomination:
1. Tap the denomination button to select it.
2. Use the numpad on the right to enter how many you have.
3. The total updates automatically.

The **Kick Drawer** button opens the cash drawer so you can count what's inside.

The count per denomination is capped at **999** to prevent accidental large entries.
